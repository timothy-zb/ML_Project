Description: This project aims to analyse historical economic growth trends using the German
Credit Data dataset.

Insight Deliverable: The insights from this analysis can include identifying factors that influence
economic growth, predicting future economic trends, and assessing the impact of credit data on
economic stability.

We used the following models for classification :

1. Perceptron Algorithm 
2. ANN
3. Fishers Linear Discriminant 
4. KNN
5. Naive Bayes Classifier
